# Why not PHP-FIG?
The reason is that not everyone agrees with all of standards mentioned in [fig-standards](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards), but the did a lot of work.
So here is alternative standard, based of PHP-FIG's.
It contains the same items, PHP-FIG pointed out right aspects of code and did a lot of work for this, but content of many of them is changed.

If you do not agree with PHP-FIG - you can try to use this one.
