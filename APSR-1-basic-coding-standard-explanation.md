Underscores are used consistently everywhere, why - explained in [APSR-0](https://github.com/nazar-pc/APSR/blob/master/APSR-0.md).

Class name is more like container (with methods and properties inside), so, consistently like namespaces class  name starts with capital letter.

PHP 5.2.x style removed because it is too old.

Properties, methods all uses underscores for words separation and all lowercase.

However, if variable contains instance of object - it can be named similarly with capital letter.
